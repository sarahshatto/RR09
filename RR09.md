Several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site. 

* Text input: used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names 
* Password input: like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered
* Text area open(multi line) longer areas of text

* Making Choices: 
    * Radio buttons
    * Check boxes
    * Drop Down boxes
* Submitting forms: 
    * Submit buttons 
        * to submit data from your form to another web page
    * Image buttons 
        * similar to a submit button but they allow you to use an image
* Submitting files
    * file upload
        * allows users to upload files to a website 

How forms work: 
1. User fills in form, presses a submit button to submit info to server
2. Name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects. 
3. server processes the info using a programming language (PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java) It may also store the information in a database.
4. Server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the info received 

A form can have many different form controls, giving different bits of info to the server. The server needs to know what inputted info corresponds with which form element. (name value pairs)



<form> form controls live inside this element
action : attribute for the form element. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the info in the form once it's submitted.
method: forms can be sent by using one of two methods:get or post.

        Example: <form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get"> </form>



<input> this element is used to create several different form controls. the value of the type attribute determines what kind of input it will create. 
type ="text" creates a single line of text input. 
name attribute that id's the form control and is sent along with the info they enter into the server. 

    Example: <form action="http://www.example.com/login.php"> 
                    <p> Username:
                   <input type="text" name="username" />
                  </p>
                  </form>

type = password creates a text vibes that acts just like a single line input, but the characters are all blocked out. 
<textarea> element is used to create a multiline text input. </textarea>

There are several CSS properties designed to work with lists/tables/forms. 

Bullet point styles: 
* list-style-type is a CSS property that can control what type of bullet point you'd like to use for ordered or unordered lists

                Example: 

                                ul {
                                list-style-type: lower-roman;
                                }

* list-style-image you can specify an image to act as a bullet point. 

                Example:
                                ul {
                                list-style-image: url("images/star.png");
                                }

                                li {
                                margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px
                                }
